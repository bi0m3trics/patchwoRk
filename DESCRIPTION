Description: This package implements multiple patch delineation algorithms [at present it only implements 'PatchMorph' (Girvetz & Greco 2007), which can delineate patches across a range of spatial scales based on three organism-specific thresholds - (1) land cover density threshold, (2) habitat gap maximum thickness (gap threshold), and (3) habitat patch minimum thickness (spur threshold)].
